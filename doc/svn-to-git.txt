When preparing the SIFT projects for sharing, I had to convert some
svn repositories to git. I wanted to maintain the history as much as
possible.

I started following these recipes, but then Eric suggested an
alternative using svn2git.

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-and-Other-Systems-Migrating-to-Git

Here's what I did:

* 1. Prepare user name conversion
I ran this command in the root of the repository, to catch all
authors, not just the ones who have touched the code.

: svn log -q | awk -F '|' '/^r/ {sub("^ ", "", $2); sub(" $", "", $2); print $2" = "$2" <"$2">"}' | sort -u > authors-transform.txt

I repeated this for the CLIC and lisp-utils repos, then merged the
results and edited the conversions to include names and email
addresses.

* 2. Clone the svn repo
I used the svn2git tool:
https://github.com/nirvdrum/svn2git

Which I installed like:
: sudo gem install svn2git

Then commands like these:
: mkdir spire-git
: cd spire-git
: svn2git [top-level-repo-url] -v --trunk=trunk/spire --nobranches --notags --authors ../authors-transform.txt

* 3. Populate project at GitLab
First I make the project for the SIFT group at GitLab, with the
permissions set to private. Then, I go to the project settings and add
the CwC group to the project.

Added GitLab as origin of the local repo:
: git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/sift/spire.git

Then pushed the repo:
: git push -u origin master
